The AZEditor is intended to be used as the editor for the AZEngine
(https://github.com/aaron-stafford/AZEngine) which is a tool for converting
scxml in to C++ code.

The AZEditor was orginally a project on google code:
(https://code.google.com/p/scxmlgui/). It has been exported here so that it can
be modified specifically for AZEgine's needs. And because ... well ... git :)

Building the project
====================

In the root of the project, simply run:

> ant

Launching the editor
====================

The editor can be launched from the command line with the following command:

> java -jar extra/fsm-editor.jar

Prior to committing
===================

Run:

> astyle -R *.java

The formatting style used is taken from .astylerc you will need to put this
file in a place where astyle can read it, eg; $HOME/.astylerc 

See:

> astyle -h

for more info.
