The AZEditor is intended to be used as the editor for the AZEngine
(https://github.com/aaron-stafford/AZEngine) which is a tool for converting
scxml in to C++ code.

The AZEditor was orginally a project on google code:
(https://code.google.com/p/scxmlgui/). It has been exported here so that it can
be modified specifically for AZEgine's needs. And because ... well ... git :)
